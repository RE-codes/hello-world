RE-codes Depot
This is my step at starting something completely new. I have not played with coding or programming of any kind in well over a decade, but I have always enjoyed the challenge of solving problems and creating things using nothing but lines of code. I feel like the environment is ripe to make this kind of change, and the benefits of a successful career in coding would be invaluable to my family. Wish me luck!
